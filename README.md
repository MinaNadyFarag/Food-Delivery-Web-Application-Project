# Food Delivery Web Application Project
 We have developed a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the food delivery process for both customers and restaurants. The platform allows users to browse a wide variety of local restaurants, view menus, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time. Key features of the project include a user-friendly interface, secure payment processing, and personalized recommendations based on user preferences. For restaurant partners, the application provides tools to manage orders, update menus, and analyze sales data. This project demonstrates our ability to integrate multiple technologies to create a seamless and efficient online food delivery experience, catering to the needs of both consumers and businesses.
